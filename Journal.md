#### Question to Tuesday Oct 1 presentations:

(Linh) What's the parameter to distinguish between the need for theater performance with real-human actors and the need for theater performance with human-lookalike robots besides the purpose of storytelling and functions of the performers?

(Toomie) Based on Japanese tradition where people believe every inanimate object has a soul, where do we differentiate between a talking robots created by humans and another robotic object created by humans to incoporate into our lives if that becomes the case?
